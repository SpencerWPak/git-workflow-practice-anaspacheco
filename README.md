# Opinion -  "The wizards of AI canâ€™t give it a brain, or heart, or consciousness" #

**Opinion**: I find this article interesting because it describes the several 
limitations of current AI Chat models, bringing attention to the fundamental challenges the software faces in truly incorporating human-like understanding and consciousness. Also, I find it particularly important becuase it serves as a reminder of the significance of maintaining a realistic perspective on AI's capabilities, particularly for those without knowledge of NLP and AI who might have fears of AI becoming uncontrollable.

This article also brings into perspective how far AI really is from taking over the world. A big fear is that AI models are going to take jobs and change how the world works while we really are very far away from that. While it may come some time in the future this article is good at showing a more realistic view on where AI currently stands.
